To do at some point:
1. Make it so I can use joystick and speedup button at the same time. (Currently, if I am moving using joystick, I have to let it go before the speedup button becomes pressable).
This will require a rework of how I handle touches, right?
I will have to do some research when I will implement this to do thingie, but currently it is not important.
